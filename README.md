# imagenormalizer
Image Normalizer is a cross-platform command-line batch-processing tool that resizes and compresses images, transforming each image by:
* applying EXIF Orientation to the image, if tag present
* resizing it to fit within the maximum width/height supplied, if necessary
* compressing it to the provided image quality level
* removing its EXIF, IPTC, XMP and Color profile data, if option set and data present
* saving it in the JPEG format with the .jpg file extension

The supported image formats are: bmp, cr2, cur, dds, dng, exr, fts, gif, hdr, heic, heif, ico, jfif, jp2, jpe/jpeg/jpg, jps, mng, nef, nrw, orf, pam, pbm, pcd, pcx, pef, pes, pfm, pgm, picon, pict, png, ppm, psd, qoi, raf, rw2, sgi, svg, tga, tif/tiff, wbmp, webp, xbm, xpm.

Image Normalizer is intended to facilitate the storage of images produced by digital cameras in a consistent and disc space conserving manner.

It is written in C#, and targets .NET 8 on Linux and Windows. It relies on [Magick.NET](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET), as its image manipulation library.
